> "Remember thereâ€™s no such thing as a small act of kindness. Every act creates a ripple with no logical end." - Scott Adams

This quote emphasizes that every act of kindness, no matter how small, can have a positive impact on the world. By treating others with kindness, we can create a ripple effect that spreads outwards and inspires others to do the same. Even a simple smile or a kind word can make a difference in someone's day, and by consistently choosing to act with kindness, we can contribute to a more compassionate and empathetic world.
